# R1 Digital Painting App - Comprehensive Summary

## App Overview

The R1 Digital Painting App is a modern, touch-optimized digital art application specifically designed for the R1 device. It provides professional-grade painting tools in a web-based, portable format with an emphasis on intuitive user experience and creative expression through advanced drawing tools and AI integration.

### Key Features

- **Drawing Tools**:
  - Brush tool for traditional drawing
  - Kaleidoscope painting tool for creating symmetrical, pattern-based strokes
  - Symmetry drawing tools for mirrored drawing across multiple axes
  - Drip paint tool for realistic paint dripping effects
  - Lines tool for clean geometric line drawing
  - Sacred geometry tool for creating geometric patterns with audio feedback

- **AI Integration**:
  - LLM-powered creative advice for artistic inspiration
  - Email sharing functionality using base64 image data

- **UI Features**:
  - Touch-friendly interface optimized for the R1 device
  - Color palette management with canvas and brush color selection
  - Undo functionality and canvas clearing
  - Tool cycling via scroll wheel or keyboard navigation

## R1 Environment

The R1 device is a specialized hardware platform with the following characteristics:

### Hardware Specifications
- **Display**: 240x282 pixel screen
- **Input Methods**: 
  - Scroll wheel for navigation
  - PTT (Push-to-Talk) button for primary actions
  - Touchscreen support

### Software Environment
- **Runtime**: WebView-based environment for running web applications
- **Communication**: All communication between the WebView and native system must go through the LLM via PluginMessageHandler
- **Security**: Direct external API calls from the WebView are blocked for security reasons

## R1 SDK Integration

### Communication Architecture
All communication from the WebView to the Flutter app on R1 must go through the LLM via PluginMessageHandler. Direct native calls are not possible. However, messages can include special commands and flags (e.g., `useLLM: false`, `wantsR1Response: false`) to instruct the R1 system to handle certain operations natively without LLM processing the payload.

### PluginMessageHandler
The primary communication channel between the web app and the R1 system:

```javascript
window.PluginMessageHandler.postMessage(JSON.stringify({
  message: "Your message here",
  imageBase64: "base64_encoded_image_data", // Optional
  useLLM: true, // Whether to process through LLM
  wantsR1Response: false // Whether to expect a response
}));
```

### Hardware Event Handling
The app listens for native hardware events:
- `scrollUp` and `scrollDown` for tool cycling
- `sideClick` for PTT button actions

### Special Considerations
1. **App Stability**: When sending messages to the LLM via PluginMessageHandler, the `window.onPluginMessage` handler must explicitly prevent any default behavior that could cause the app to close using `event.preventDefault()` and `event.stopImmediatePropagation()`.

2. **Email Functionality**: The app sends artwork via email by:
   - Capturing canvas as base64 data
   - Sending to LLM with `imageBase64` field
   - Including converter URL (https://base64toimage.github.io/) in the message
   - Setting `wantsR1Response: false` to prevent app closing

3. **Security Restrictions**: Direct external API calls from the WebView are blocked, so all external communication must be handled by the R1 system.

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Key Functionalities

### PTT Button (Email Sending)
When the PTT button is pressed:
1. The app captures the canvas as a PNG image
2. Converts the image to base64 data
3. Sends a message to the LLM with:
   - Instructions to send an email with the artwork
   - Base64 data in the `imageBase64` field
   - Converter URL in the message body
   - `wantsR1Response: false` to prevent app closing

### LLM Tool (Creative Advice)
When the LLM tool is activated:
1. Sends a message to the LLM requesting creative drawing prompts
2. Sets `wantsR1Response: true` to receive and display the response
3. Shows the advice in an overlay on the screen

### Tool Selection
Users can cycle through tools using:
- Scroll wheel (up/down)
- Keyboard arrow keys (up/down)
- Enter key to activate the selected tool

## Design Principles

1. **Touch-Friendly Interface**: All buttons and controls are sized appropriately for touch interaction
2. **Minimalist Design**: Clean, modern aesthetic with focus on functionality
3. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient canvas rendering and minimal DOM manipulation
4. **Stability**: Proper event handling to prevent app crashes or unwanted closures

## Testing and Deployment

### Testing
- Test on actual R1 device for proper hardware integration
- Verify PTT button functionality sends emails correctly
- Confirm LLM tool provides creative advice
- Ensure app remains stable and doesn't close unexpectedly

### Deployment
- Build using `npm run build`
- Deploy as static files to R1 device
- App runs in fullscreen WebView environment
